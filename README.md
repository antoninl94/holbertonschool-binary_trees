# Holberton School - Binary Trees

This repository contains projects related to **Binary Trees**, part of the **Holberton School** curriculum. The goal of this project is to help to understand the structure and manipulation of binary trees, a key data structure used in many computer science algorithms and applications.

## Overview

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right children. In this repository, we cover key concepts of binary trees and implement various operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and more.

The project provides a foundation for understanding how binary trees work and how to implement them efficiently.

## Projects

This repository includes the following key projects related to binary trees:

- **[0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c)**: Create a new binary tree node with a given value.
- **[1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](./1-binary_tree_insert_left.c)**: Insert a node as the left child of another node in the binary tree.
- **[2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c)**: Insert a node as the right child of another node in the binary tree.
- **[3-binary_tree_delete.c](./3-binary_tree_delete.c)**: Delete an entire binary tree.
- **[4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c)**: Check if a node is a leaf node (no children).
- **[5-binary_tree_is_root.c](./5-binary_tree_is_root.c)**: Check if a node is the root of the binary tree.
- **[6-binary_tree_preorder.c](./6-binary_tree_preorder.c)**: Perform a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
- **[7-binary_tree_inorder.c](./7-binary_tree_inorder.c)**: Perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree.
- **[8-binary_tree_postorder.c](./8-binary_tree_postorder.c)**: Perform a post-order traversal of the binary tree.
- **[9-binary_tree_height.c](./9-binary_tree_height.c)**: Measure the height of a binary tree.
- **[10-binary_tree_depth.c](./10-binary_tree_depth.c)**: Measure the depth of a node in the binary tree.
- **[11-binary_tree_size.c](./11-binary_tree_size.c)**: Calculate the size (number of nodes) of the binary tree.
- **[12-binary_tree_leaves.c](./12-binary_tree_leaves.c)**: Count the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree.
- **[13-binary_tree_nodes.c](./13-binary_tree_nodes.c)**: Count the number of non-leaf nodes in the binary tree.
- **[14-binary_tree_balance.c](./14-binary_tree_balance.c)**: Calculate the balance factor of a binary tree.
- **[15-binary_tree_is_full.c](./15-binary_tree_is_full.c)**: Check if a binary tree is full (every node has 0 or 2 children).
- **[16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c](./16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c)**: Check if a binary tree is perfect (all leaf nodes are at the same level and all internal nodes have two children).
- **[17-binary_tree_sibling.c](./17-binary_tree_sibling.c)**: Find the sibling of a node in the binary tree.
- **[18-binary_tree_uncle.c](./18-binary_tree_uncle.c)**: Find the uncle of a node in the binary tree.

Each file implements a specific function or algorithm related to binary trees. The files are written in C and are designed to help students practice and apply their knowledge of data structures.

## Data Structures Covered

The repository covers several fundamental binary tree operations, including:

- **Node structure**: Defining a binary tree node.
- **Traversal techniques**: Pre-order, in-order, post-order traversals.
- **Binary Tree properties**: Checking leaf nodes, root nodes, tree height, tree size, etc.
- **Advanced operations**: Checking for a balanced or perfect binary tree, finding siblings or uncles, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming**: All functions and operations are implemented in C.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing the project code.
- **Linux/Unix**: The operating system environment where the code is executed and tested.

## Installation

To get started with the **Binary Trees** project, clone the repository to your local machine:
